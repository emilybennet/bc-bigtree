  <h1>Happy April 1st!</h1>
  <p>Well, we may have fibbed a bit. Unfortunately, there is no &ldquo;BronyCon @ Home&rdquo; kit. The only way to experience BronyCon is live and in person, Aug. 1-3 in Baltimore, Md. Good thing it&rsquo;s also the best way!</p>
  <p>Thanks for playing along though. For being such a good sport, use promo code <strong>APRILFOOLS14</strong> for $5 off our regular three-day badge cost, today only.</p>
